### Activities - 3/1
* My variation of the roBERTa model employs the model for predicting the most likely word given 
a sequence in Spanish.

### Reflection - 3/1
* The ethical implications of NLP are far-reaching. Are models trained on "clean" datasets that are 
free of racist/sexist/homophobic speech? Can models be used to fuel the spread of falsified propaganda online?
  Can models be used to manipulate unsuspecting social media users into scams? We need to actively address
  these issues before the inevitable proliferation of nlp models into our everyday lives.
