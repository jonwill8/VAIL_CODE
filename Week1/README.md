## Reflection - 2/8/21

     I hope to gain a deeper understanding of AI through this course. While I have built math models before that
     fit well to logged data, none of my models could make predictions on new data. I am looking forward to building AI
     models which can accurately make predictions on never before seen data. I am pretty excited to see how
     prior calculus courses I have taken tie into AI models. I am anxious to learn enough Linear Algebra to understand
     AI models.

### Question 1
    In supervised learning, you are fitting a model on labeled training data so that the model becomes very good 
    at mapping inputs to the outputs you deem are correct (ex: you may train a classifier model on images of 
    apples/oranges such that it becomes really good at seeing a new image of an apple/orange and then 
    categorizing it correctly). In supervised learning, you must balance the bias vs variance of your model 
    (low bias and high variance means high accuracy but low model applicability to different data sets, 
    while high bias and low variance means low accuracy but high model applicability to different data sets)

    In unsupervised learning, you are employing an ML model on unlabeled/messy data such 
    that the model can find patterns in the data which are unapparent to humans. Unsupervised models 
    are generally more complex and it is harder to rate the accuracy of an unsupervised ML model.
