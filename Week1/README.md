## Reflection - 2/8/21

     I hope to gain a deeper understanding of AI through this course. While I have built math models before that
     fit well to logged data, none of my models could make predictions on new data. I am looking forward to building AI
     models which can accurately make predictions on never before seen data. I am pretty excited to see how
     prior calculus courses I have taken tie into AI models. I am anxious to learn enough Linear Algebra to understand
     AI models.
